# pprecord
PrettyPrint Haskell records generically!

## About
This library includes classes and functions designed to accumulate and format
record field acessors and their corresponding values. Recursive types are
expanded in formatting. For detailed documentation
and example usage read the [docs](https://paroxayte.github.io/pprecord/Text-PrettyPrint-Records.html).
For advanced formatting, this library depends on Text.PrettyPrint.Boxes from the
[boxes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/boxes-0.1.5) package.
